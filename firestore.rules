/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for MediScan Assist.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data stored under their /users/{userId} path.
 * @data_structure All user data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring clear ownership.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - Users cannot list all other users.
 *   - Data validation is relaxed during prototyping to focus on authorization.
